        Debt Management Plan (DMP)
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        A Debt Management Plan (DMP) is an informal agreement between you and
        your creditors, where you arrange to pay off your debts through lower
        monthly payments than your contractual payments. Your creditors may
        agree to freeze interest and charges, giving you reassurance that your
        debts are not continuing to grow. A DMP is not a legally binding debt
        solution and wonâ€™t appear on any public registers, so nobody needs to
        know about your DMP unless you tell them.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-heroAccent">
        How does a DMP work?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
        You can arrange your own repayment plan with creditors, or you can use
        DebtPlus to set up a DMP on your behalf. This reduces the legwork for
        you and ensures your plan is managed by experienced professionals.
