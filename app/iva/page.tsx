      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        An IVA is a legally binding agreement set up between you and your creditors for you to repay an amount you can afford over a fixed period of time; usually around five years. It allows any unsecured debts to be written off at the end of the IVA.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
        With an IVA, a considerable amount of your unsecured debt could be written-off. However, the figure will vary depending on your circumstances.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The reason for this is because the monthly amount you pay into the arrangement is based on your disposable income. Your disposable income is worked out after we have looked at your incoming and outgoings to understand how much money you have leftover to pay your creditors.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
        As an example, in a 5 year IVA if you have £100 a month leftover to pay your creditors you will make 60 monthly payments of £100 = £6000.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
        If your unsecured debt was £20,000, at the end of the 5 years, the remaining £14,000 will be written off and you will be debt-free.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Last year, we wrote-off 80% of debt in half of all cases for clients who didn’t own a home.
