        A Trust Deed is a legally binding formal arrangement between you and your
        creditors to repay some of your unsecured debts. Available only in
        Scotland.

        Generally speaking, for a Trust Deed, you’ll need to have unsecured debts
        of £5,000 or over and be in a position to make regular payments over a
        fixed period. A Trustee will take care of the day to day running of your
        Trust Deed and liaise with your creditors so you don’t pay them
        directly.
